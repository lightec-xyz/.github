# Lightec

We are developers focused on Zero Knowledge Proof for Bitcoin and Ethereum. We are currently developing [zkBTC](https://www.zkbtc.money/), which is a ZKP-based bridge from Bitcoin to Ethereum. For our purpose and for the public good of the developer community, we have open sourced [chainark](https://github.com/lightec-xyz/chainark), a ZKP library to prove a chain of any given relationship with one single proof. We also contributed [BLS12-381 G2 signature verification circuit](https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/pull/1040).

We also proposed [opZKP upgrade to Bitcoin](https://github.com/opzkp/tea-horse), which is still under development.

Follow us and stay tune.
